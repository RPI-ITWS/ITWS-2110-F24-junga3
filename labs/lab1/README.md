WORK DONE:
Wrote analysis for Article 1, 2, 6, 7, Amendments 1-12 and History of the Constitution
HTML/CSS for History tab on the website


REFLECTION:
A major point of where we got stuck was the idea of the interactivity of the website. We needed a way to incorporate a way for the user to interact with the website and have the website not static with walls of text. Jesse came up with the idea of mimicking a GitHub commit page for displaying the information. This also helped me get unstuck with how to display the history of the constitution as I drew inspiration from how GitHub handles pdf files and displays them. Instead of having text just on a page with no theme we were able to use the GitHub theme as an outline.

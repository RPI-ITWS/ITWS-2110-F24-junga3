Here is documentation for a totally free, no sign-up required, API: https://www.frankfurter.app/docs/

You must use the /latest endpoint (https://api.frankfurter.app/latest). You must make an API call to retrieve the JSON data. Use PHP to take that JSON data and put it in your database. Then pull the JSON out of the database to display on your frontend.

Take your openweathermap API and the other API you selected for Lab 3 and integrate all this information into one interesting (and hopefully coherent, though that is not a requirement) single-page web app. Anything that is acceptable to use on a lab is OK to use here. You may creatively reuse code you’ve already written…

Be creative! In the grading rubric, half of the score is creativity. The other half is implementing the above correctly. I want to see a lot more than black text on a white background.

Finally, write a README.md file explaining everything you did, documenting your creativity, and citing your sources.

quiz 1 - junga3

https://junga3rpi.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com/ITWS-2110-F24-junga3/quiz1/


First I just did a basic api call with the frankfurter API. I then copied over my lab2 code for handling the other APIs into this. I wanted to focus on the frontend first as that gives the most points accoridng to the rubric. I was not able to complete the database setup so I will lose all points for the php/mysql and I focused my time on the other parts of the quizzes. I had a personal website that I was able to refernece the styling for and was able to copy most of it into this quiz.

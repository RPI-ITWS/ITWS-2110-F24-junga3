# Morville’s HoneyComb 7 Lenses and Laws of UX
## 1. Useful 
### Observations: 
Currently Lab 3 has buttons to load the data from the API calls and then the data from the database. Then the user can also update the information from the database. Then see all the data get changed in real time.
### Successes:
The lab has aspects of usefulness as it calls relevant and up to date information from the APIs to show the user.
### Improvements:
The improvements is allowing for a more streamlined process to get the information from the website.
### Laws of UX:
- Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule) - focus on what 20% benefits 80% of users
### Implemented Changes:
Pareto Priniple talks about giving attention to the area that would benefit the majority of users. So to do this I consolidated all 4 of the buttons into one that would serve the same function. Instead of the user needing to press all 4 to get the weather and the calendar information they just need to press one.

## 2. Usable
### Observations:
The lab had 4 different buttons to load the same information. Consolidating these buttons into a simple interface with one button will imporve usable for the lab.
### Successes:
Looking at the lab something that was successful was that it kept the site barebones without any flair. This improved usability as it kept the site straightfoward.
### Improvements:
Something to improve is getting rid of redundant buttons. Both the API and MySQL buttons labeled do the same thing in displying the information to the user.
### Laws of UX:
- Chunking - a bigger set is broken down and then grouped together
- Doherty Threshold - keep processes under 400 ms to increase productivity
- Law of Prägnanz - people find simplicty in complex shapes
- Miller's Law - average person can only remember 7 things in working memory
- Occam's Razor - remove as many additional items as possible
- Serial Position Effect - users tend to remember first and last things in a list
- Tesler's Law - for anything complexity needs to be there for functionality
- Zeigarnik Effect - users remember uncompleted tasks better than completed ones
### Implemented Changes:
Got rid of the extra buttons and combined them into one fetch data button. This allows for a more straight foward implementation of the lab. It gives the user the ability to see the data easier with less clutter. This follows the Occam's razor law of ux of getting rid of as much additional items as possible.

## 3. Findable
### Observations:
Due to everything being on one page and data is shown on the same page. No need for the user to go look for the data thet are trying to find. The webpage also goes from top to bottom to help guide the user see what to do first.
### Successes:
As mentioned in the observations, the user follows the webpage from top to bottom to see what to do. Keeping this flow will help with in fufilling the findable lens of ux.
### Improvements:
Something to improve on would be simplifying the ui even further. This will help in the cogntive load for the user and also make the experience more simple. Keeping it simple will imporve the findability for data on my website.
### Laws of UX:
- Cognitive Load - the amount of things needed to be used to understand and interact with the web app.
- Law of Common Region - items in an enclosed boundary are grouped together
- Law of Proximity - items close to one another are grouped by the user's mind
- Law of Similarity - similar elements in a design as part of a complete picture, group or shape
- Von Restorff Effect - when one thing stands out from the rest it is easier to be remembered
### Implemented Changes:
Some changes that I implemented was keeping the top to bottom design of my website but implementing it better with less clutter in the buttons and between the different data shown. I also was able to give a simple direction for the user to be able to retrieve the data. The button for retrieving the data now follows the Von Restorff Effect of standing the button out with the styling. It is a white button with a glow effect on a black background. This draws the eye to it and it will be easier to remember and also easier to be pressed by the user.

## 4. Credible
### Observations:
The lab calls us to use apis to get information. I do not reference or link back to the APIs used for the lab so including that will improve the credibility of my lab as a whole.
### Successes:
Currently I have no successess when presented to an user. The APIs were used in the backend but not referenced in the frontend. 
### Improvements:
Adding the documentation for these APIs will be helpful in improving credibility.
### Laws of UX:
- Jakob's Law - users transfer how other sites work to your site
- Cognitive Bias - favoring mental shortcuts and wanting to use the least amount of mental energy
### Implemented Changes:
I added documentation to the footer of the website. This will help users see what APIs I used and also that the information was accurate as it is based on these APIs. A law of UX to implement was cogntive bias. Improving and lowering the amount of things for the user to do to get data helps improve my site as a whole.

## 5. Desirable
### Observations:
Before my lab had many different colors and also a differing in font for the items such as the button having totally different styling when compared to the data in the body of the site.
### Successes:
Some success was the barebones approach I had before. I had no fluff on the site and it was minmalist. This is something I want to further and also x
### Improvements:
Some imporvments would be to adopt an aestheically pleasing design for the lab. This will help allign with the Aesthetic-Usability Effect Law of UX. Having a two tone color pallete will make the website look more minimalistic.
### Laws of UX:
- Aesthetic-Usability Effect - the more aestheically pleasing a design is the better it is perceived
- Peak-End Rule - users judge their experience on the peak and at the end rather than the whole process
### Implemented Changes:
I implemented the aesthetic change talked about above. I changed the color pallete of the site to a two tone effect of just a simple black and white. This will be alligned with the law of ux in the Aesthetic-Usability Effect, which states a more aestheically pleasing design will help be percieved as more desirable by the user.

## 6. Accessible
### Observations:
Currently my lab does not have that much accesible elements. The button styling which I got from a css buttons website is big enough to be pressed. The site also has no small text. This would be something I want to continue after doing the redesign.
### Successes:
Some success would be that the text is easy to read and the buttons are big enough to be easily hit. This goes along with Fitt's Law of UX.
### Improvements:
Some imporvements would be keeping the same font size when improving the lab or increasing the size. This would help in keeping it accessible for everyone.
### Laws of UX:
- Fitts's Law - touch targets should be easy to hit
- Hick's Law - an increase number of options leads to a longer decision
### Implemented Changes:
Hick's Law was demonstarted on my website as there are only 2 options for the user to interact with. This helps lower the decision time for the user and also the complexity that is associated with the site.

## 7. Valuable
### Observations:
Value in this sense I would say would be accurate information. My data that I pass is accurate and up to date as I call the API each time the user presses the button.
### Successes:
A success would be the refresh calling of APIs whenever the user needs the information.
### Improvements:
No imporvements could be made here as I feel the website has the maxed amount of value when adhering to the lab instructions.
### Laws of UX:
- Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule) - focus on what 20% benefits 80% of users
### Implemented Changes:
No changes implemented.

# Overview
I enjoyed this lab a lot as I have a interest in UI/UX as a whole. For this lab I wanted to cut down on the redundant items and also make the site look better as a whole. I based a majority of the design choices on my personal website(junga.site) as I worked hard on improving the aesthtics of my website. I was able to copy and paste my css file for my website and use a majority of the css for styling my lab page.

lab 6 - junga3 - UI/UX Improvements

# Lab Rubric
Lab 6
Due: 11/15 EOD

Look at your current lab (whatever your lab is like after lab 5) through the lens of each one of the items in Morville’s honeycomb. For each of the seven lenses, write in your README.md file what you observe, what your areas of success are, and where your opportunities for improvement are. Using the Laws of UX site (https://lawsofux.com/), figure out which laws map to which lens. Then do your best to implement one area of improvement for each lens (and tell us what you did in your README.md file).

You may work with your group and me and the TAs to identify success/opportunities and map laws to lenses. You must work by yourself to do the implementing.

As always, you must cite all your sources in your README.md file. Failure to cite sources = 0 on lab. You must also include a ZAP report (-10 if no ZAP report).

# Morville’s HoneyComb 7 Lenses and Laws of UX
## 1. Useful 
### Observations: 
Currently Lab 3 has buttons to load the data from the API calls and then the data from the database. Then the user can also update the information from the database. Then see all the data get changed in real time.
### Successes:
The lab has aspects of usefulness as it calls relevant and up to date information from the APIs to show the user.
### Improvements:
The improvements is allowing for a more streamlined process to get the information from the website.
### Laws of UX:
- Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule) - focus on what 20% benefits 80% of users
### Implemented Changes:
Pareto Priniple talks about giving attention to the area that would benefit the majority of users. So to do this I consolidated all 4 of the buttons into one that would serve the same function. Instead of the user needing to press all 4 to get the weather and the calendar information they just need to press one.

## 2. Usable
### Observations:
The lab had 4 different buttons to load the same information. Consolidating these buttons into a simple interface with one button will imporve usable for the lab.
### Successes:
Looking at the lab something that was successful was that it kept the site barebones without any flair. This improved usability as it kept the site straightfoward.
### Improvements:
Something to improve is getting rid of redundant buttons. Both the API and MySQL buttons labeled do the same thing in displying the information to the user.
### Laws of UX:
- Chunking - a bigger set is broken down and then grouped together
- Doherty Threshold - keep processes under 400 ms to increase productivity
- Law of Prägnanz - people find simplicty in complex shapes
- Miller's Law - average person can only remember 7 things in working memory
- Occam's Razor - remove as many additional items as possible
- Serial Position Effect - users tend to remember first and last things in a list
- Tesler's Law - for anything complexity needs to be there for functionality
- Zeigarnik Effect - users remember uncompleted tasks better than completed ones
### Implemented Changes:
Got rid of the extra buttons and combined them into one fetch data button. This allows for a more straight foward implementation of the lab. It gives the user the ability to see the data easier with less clutter. This follows the Occam's razor law of ux of getting rid of as much additional items as possible.

## 3. Findable
### Observations:
Due to everything being on one page and data is shown on the same page. No need for the user to go look for the data thet are trying to find. The webpage also goes from top to bottom to help guide the user see what to do first.
### Successes:
As mentioned in the observations, the user follows the webpage from top to bottom to see what to do. Keeping this flow will help with in fufilling the findable lens of ux.
### Improvements:
Something to improve on would be simplifying the ui even further. This will help in the cogntive load for the user and also make the experience more simple. Keeping it simple will imporve the findability for data on my website.
### Laws of UX:
- Cognitive Load - the amount of things needed to be used to understand and interact with the web app.
- Law of Common Region - items in an enclosed boundary are grouped together
- Law of Proximity - items close to one another are grouped by the user's mind
- Law of Similarity - similar elements in a design as part of a complete picture, group or shape
- Von Restorff Effect - when one thing stands out from the rest it is easier to be remembered
### Implemented Changes:
Some changes that I implemented was keeping the top to bottom design of my website but implementing it better with less clutter in the buttons and between the different data shown. I also was able to give a simple direction for the user to be able to retrieve the data. The button for retrieving the data now follows the Von Restorff Effect of standing the button out with the styling. It is a white button with a glow effect on a black background. This draws the eye to it and it will be easier to remember and also easier to be pressed by the user.

## 4. Credible
### Observations:
The lab calls us to use apis to get information. I do not reference or link back to the APIs used for the lab so including that will improve the credibility of my lab as a whole.
### Successes:
### Improvements:
### Laws of UX:
- Jakob's Law - users transfer how other sites work to your site
- Cognitive Bias - favoring mental shortcuts and wanting to use the least amount of mental energy
### Implemented Changes:

## 5. Desirable
### Observations:
### Successes:
### Improvements:
### Laws of UX:
- Aesthetic-Usability Effect - the more aestheically pleasing a design is the better it is perceived
- Peak-End Rule - users judge their experience on the peak and at the end rather than the whole process
### Implemented Changes:

## 6. Accessible
### Observations:
### Successes:
### Improvements:
### Laws of UX:
- Fitts's Law - touch targets should be easy to hit
- Hick's Law - an increase number of options leads to a longer decision
### Implemented Changes:

## 7. Valuable
### Observations:
### Successes:
### Improvements:
### Laws of UX:
- Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule) - focus on what 20% benefits 80% of users
### Implemented Changes:

# Overview
I enjoyed this lab a lot as I have a interest in UI/UX as a whole. For this lab I wanted to cut down on the redundant items and also make the site look better as a whole. I based a majority of the design choices on my personal website(junga.site) as I worked hard on improving the aesthtics of my website. I was able to copy and paste my css file for my website and use a majority of the css for styling my lab page.
